# NLP Project

Predicting webpages without the actual webpage.


## Getting started with the code

Before you can run most of the code, you need to download and organize the appropriate datasets and word embeddings. See [`src/data/README.md`][data-readme] and [`src/word_embed/README.md`][word-readme] for how to do this.

You will also need to install dependencies. Navigato to `src/` and run `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Testing

This project uses `pytest` for testing. After having installed dependencies, you can simply run `$ pytest` to run all tests.
