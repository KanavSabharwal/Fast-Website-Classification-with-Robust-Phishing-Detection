Predicting webpages without the actual webpage.


## Getting started with the code

Before you can run most of the code, you need to download and organize the appropriate datasets and word embeddings. See [`src/data/README.md`][data-readme] and [`src/word_embed/README.md`][word-readme] for how to do this.


[data-readme]: ./src/data/README.md
[word-readme]: ./src/word_embed/README.md
